# Description

One of my favorite algorithms for its simplicity and result is the noise spiral. With it a spiral is drawn with the coordinates of the lines comprising the spiral varying from the "perfect circle" position using Perlin noise. I build upon this algorithm by tweaking how the spiral coordinates are created and layering spirals on top of each other in different positions.
