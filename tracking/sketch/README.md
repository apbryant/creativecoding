# Description

This sketch generates shapes whose vertices are Lissajous curves. By filling the shape, geometric patterns are created. As the number of points increases, so does the intricacy of the resulting shape. By changing the values passed to the function that creates the coordinates, images with different curves are generated.

Thanks @joncampbelldev for the with-matrix macro.
